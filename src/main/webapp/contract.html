            <h1><b>Who Did What</b></h1>
            <br>
            <h4><b>What did Benjamin do?</b></h4>
            I made everything related to the “Our Cool Jokes” page; the Joke entity class, JokeFacade, JokeResource and all of their respective tests. I also made the “ourCoolJokes.html” page and the JavaScript for it. Other than that, I made some minor fixes around the project to make sure it could deploy on Travis.
            <br><br>
            <h4><b>What did Matt do?</b></h4>
            I was "assigned" the task to make the members table i.e. all the classes, facade, and tests containing 'GroupMember'. I also set up the index page and made the javascript linked at the bottom (fetchmembers.js). Kudos to all the other group members who helped me fix my spelling errors + stupid mistakes...
            <br><br>
            <h4><b>What did Mari do?</b></h4>
            I was watcher on the Car exercise with Pelle, and then made test for car with Pelle as watcher, both in rest and facade. I also made the function sortBy in carScript.js. This was not an required exercise but due to extra time, and me spending more time as watcher we figured that I needed more commits and actual coding-time.

            <h4><b>What did Pelle do?</b></h4>
            My assignment was the Car exercise, making the enitity classes, facades, resourceClass, tests, html and Javascript.

            <h1><b>What We Did Together</b></h1>
            <br>
            We reviewed the code that each of us made together to ensure that everyone understood what had been made, and we made sure that everyone was present when we did pull requests on GitHub (merging onto the master branch).<br>
            We also all helped out whenever someone ran into problems with their parts, and came up with solutions to problems together. We spent most of the time together in a Discord chat room, even when working on our separate parts, so it was easy to help out when someone ran into problems.
